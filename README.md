# Customizing Visual Styles in Plotly

Code for a workshop originally developed for an Unconference session during the [Outlier Conference](https://outlierconf.com/) hosted by Data Visualization Society.

Ever have that feeling that a lot of data viz you see screams the tool it was made in? Using the [Plotly Open Source](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) Python graphing libraries, we will take a look under the hood of:

- the style themes available, 
- understand the visual elements like figure and chart backgrounds, and 
- build our own default theme script inspired by 1980's computers. 

This informal workshop works for a seasoned Pythonista wanting to add to your design toolbox or a newbie curious about custom interfaces beyond the usual BI tools.

#### General Disclaimer
This work is open source, like Plotly, so learn it, use it and spread the love!
Made with 💌 for the Python and data viz ecosystems under the limited liability company Data, Design & Daughters LLC doing business as Data Design Dimension by Kathryn Hurchla.
