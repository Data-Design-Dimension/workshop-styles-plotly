# workshop-styles-plotly
Ever have that feeling that a lot of data viz you see screams the tool it was made in? Using the Plotly Python libraries, we will take a look under the hood of the style themes available, understand the visual elements like figure and chart backgrounds, and build our own default theme script inspired by 1980's computers.

Join this informal workshop whether you're a seasoned Pythonista wanting to add to your design toolbox or a newbie curious about custom interfaces beyond the usual BI tools.
